Mortgage loan servicing has become an integral component of MS&F as most correspondent lending relationships have increased demands placed on them by rating and regulatory agencies. Mr. Morris has steered the company to meet today’s challenging and competitive environment by committing significant Company resources.

Additionally, he coordinates the related investment and development activities of the Company through various related partnerships and corporations.
